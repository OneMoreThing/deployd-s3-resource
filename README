This is a test app built with Deployd 0.6.0-pre, testing out the new custom resource loading. 

To get it to run, you'll have to create an S3Bucket resource called `/s3bucket` in the dashboard, with the following values:

    {
      "bucket": "BUCKET-NAME",
      "secret": "SECRET-KEY",
      "key": "S3-KEY"
    }
